<p><strong>Here’s what an agent say about us:</strong></p>

<p class="testimonial-text indent">"Since working with Eric I closed a deal in the first 8 days of being in the business, I have gotten married, re-developed great exercise and diet habits, got re-immersed in personal growth books, listen to podcasts while I drive to and from appointments, developed a good understanding of what kind of work ethic is required in real estate, improved on leadership and networking skills, it’s a long list. In my first year of real estate I beat the average current realtor, in my current year I have closed one deal a month and currently have signed 10 contracts in the last two weeks with many appointments coming up. The reason I love real estate is no two clients are the same, there’s always a new and interesting challenge to tackle I get to be creative and the sky’s the limit." <span class="testimonial-author">- Greg Koch</span></p>
