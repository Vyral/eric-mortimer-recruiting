*Is it better to work as part of a team or to work as a solo agent?*

<br>The real estate industry is challenging to work in right now, thanks to shifting market conditions, and this has left many agents looking for ways to put their careers back on track. If you’ve been working as a solo agent, perhaps the best route moving forward is to join a team.

But why? What’s so great about joining a team?

Well, first of all, while being a solo agent does mean you don’t have anyone to report to, this is actually a double-edged sword. Not reporting to anyone is great in concept, but can really damage your success and productivity in practice.

**The first major benefit of working with a team is that, unlike working on your own, you’ll never be without guidance or support**. Sure, you’re going to be held accountable to your potential—but isn’t that what you want?

Surrounding yourself with like-minded people who are real movers and shakers in the industry will always bring you greater success than trying to go it alone. You’ve probably heard of the idea that you’re the average of the five people you spend the most time with, and this is especially true in a professional setting. That’s the real value of being on a team—it will keep you accountable and help you grow.

**But what about the fear of splitting a commission?**

Think of it this way: Have you ever thought to yourself that FSBO sellers are making a mistake? After all, even though they’d have to pay a commission fee to hire an agent, they’d walk away with more money in their pocket at the end of the deal by doing so. The same applies for real estate professionals. You might have to sacrifice a small portion of your revenue to be part of a team, but that minor sacrifice actually goes toward giving you more resources and a greater opportunity to succeed. Beyond that, you’ll have a mentor working alongside you.

A lot of brokerages simply aren’t set up to offer this experience. Being on a team is truly unique in its advantages.

Of course, knowing what to do and actually doing it are two different things. It’s easy to go online and find advice about why you should join a team, but only you can take the necessary steps to follow through and do it.

As it happens, our team offers business planning workshops for just this reason. We want to help you act on your goals, so sign up for our next event soon. **<u><a target="_blank" href="https://www.eventbrite.ca/o/eric-mortimer-6168985721">Find out more information about these workshops here</a></u>**\!
