The recent increase in home prices has made home improvement loans a popular topic among homeowners. For some, taking out a home improvement loan may be a better option than purchasing a new home. At Hyland Home Loans, we offer a variety of home improvement products that can be used for existing homes or new homes.

<!--{% include cta-content-box.html %}-->

We understand that adding a pool, an outdoor kitchen, or an outdoor living area to your home can be a significant investment. **That's why we offer home improvement loans that can be combined with your first mortgage to finance these projects.** This means that you can make the upgrades you want without having to pay for them out of pocket.

Our home improvement loans can also be used to renovate the interior of your home. If you're considering purchasing a fixer-upper, we can help you finance the cost of the necessary renovations. **This way, you can turn a diamond in the rough into your dream home.**

We're committed to helping homeowners make the most of their investments. Whether you're looking to make improvements to your existing home or to purchase a new home, we're here to help. If you have any questions about our home improvement products or any other loan products we offer, please don't hesitate to contact us. You can reach us by phone or by filling out our online information form.




*Is it better to work as part of a team or to work as a solo agent?*

<br>The real estate industry is challenging to work in right now, thanks to shifting market conditions, and this has left many agents looking for ways to put their careers back on track. If you’ve been working as a solo agent, perhaps the best route moving forward is to join a team.

But why? What’s so great about joining a team?

Well, first of all, while being a solo agent does mean you don’t have anyone to report to, this is actually a double-edged sword. Not reporting to anyone is great in concept, but can really damage your success and productivity in practice.

**The first major benefit of working with a team is that, unlike working on your own, you’ll never be without guidance or support**. Sure, you’re going to be held accountable to your potential—but isn’t that what you want?

Surrounding yourself with like-minded people who are real movers and shakers in the industry will always bring you greater success than trying to go it alone. You’ve probably heard of the idea that you’re the average of the five people you spend the most time with, and this is especially true in a professional setting. That’s the real value of being on a team—it will keep you accountable and help you grow.

**But what about the fear of splitting a commission?**

Think of it this way: Have you ever thought to yourself that FSBO sellers are making a mistake? After all, even though they’d have to pay a commission fee to hire an agent, they’d walk away with more money in their pocket at the end of the deal by doing so. The same applies for real estate professionals. You might have to sacrifice a small portion of your revenue to be part of a team, but that minor sacrifice actually goes toward giving you more resources and a greater opportunity to succeed. Beyond that, you’ll have a mentor working alongside you.

A lot of brokerages simply aren’t set up to offer this experience. Being on a team is truly unique in its advantages.

Of course, knowing what to do and actually doing it are two different things. It’s easy to go online and find advice about why you should join a team, but only you can take the necessary steps to follow through and do it.

As it happens, our team offers business planning workshops for just this reason. We want to help you act on your goals, so sign up for our next event soon. **<u><a target="_blank" href="https://www.eventbrite.ca/o/eric-mortimer-6168985721">Find out more information about these workshops here</a></u>**\!
