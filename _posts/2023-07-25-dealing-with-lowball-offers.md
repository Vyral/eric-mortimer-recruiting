The recent increase in home prices has made home improvement loans a popular topic among homeowners. For some, taking out a home improvement loan may be a better option than purchasing a new home. At Hyland Home Loans, we offer a variety of home improvement products that can be used for existing homes or new homes.

We understand that adding a pool, an outdoor kitchen, or an outdoor living area to your home can be a significant investment. **That's why we offer home improvement loans that can be combined with your first mortgage to finance these projects.** This means that you can make the upgrades you want without having to pay for them out of pocket.

Our home improvement loans can also be used to renovate the interior of your home. If you're considering purchasing a fixer-upper, we can help you finance the cost of the necessary renovations. **This way, you can turn a diamond in the rough into your dream home.**

We're committed to helping homeowners make the most of their investments. Whether you're looking to make improvements to your existing home or to purchase a new home, we're here to help. If you have any questions about our home improvement products or any other loan products we offer, please don't hesitate to contact us. You can reach us by phone or by filling out our online information form.
