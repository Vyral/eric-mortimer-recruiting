Are you 100% satisfied with all areas of your life? What if you could take a magic wand and change one or two areas - what would those things be?

For thousands of years, feng shui practicers know if you can change your environment, you can change your life. They would add or subtract things from the space. What's funny though, is they would often miss the people in that equation. People can be poisoning you as well.

New research on goal contagion actually shows us that we will unconsciously adopt and start pursuing the goals of the people that surround us. Have you seen this in your life?

As a kid, I had just graduated high school and started a construction business with my brothers. I started unconsciously started adopting self destructive behaviors. I didn't have any real examples around me of people to show me the importance of personal growth or meaningful relationships. I thought, "this just isn't going to cut it anymore. Something has to change."

I left that environment and those influences, and in contrast now, I live my life by design. I spend my time with purpose driven people that have high values, and my life is spiraling up in all my life areas. I've been fortunate to build a business of being a top real estate agent, I have created events, coaching programs and transformation groups that have sold out in hours. And now these people are helping others and it keeps rippling. &nbsp;If I can do it, as a lost construction worker from Ontario, than you can too.

One big reason for the shift is because I changed my friends. It's who I do, and do not, hang around with.
