<p class="section-title">Here’s what an agent said about us…</p>

<p><span class="quote">"Since working with Eric I closed a deal in the first 8 days of being in the business, I have gotten married, re-developed great exercise and diet habits, got re-immersed in personal growth books, listen to podcasts while I drive to and from appointments, developed a good understanding of what kind of work ethic is required in real estate, improved on leadership and networking skills, it’s a long list. In my first year of real estate I beat the average current realtor, in my current year I have closed one deal a month and currently have signed 10 contracts in the last two weeks with many appointments coming up. The reason I love real estate is no two clients are the same, there’s always a new and interesting challenge to tackle I get to be creative and the sky’s the limit."</span><br>

<p>Most importantly, everything you receive is designed to start a conversation. So, if you have any questions about selling real estate you can email me at <a href="mailto:Eric@EricMortimer.com">Eric@EricMortimer.com</a>. </p>

<p>I’ll first answer your question by email, and if I think it would be of benefit to more people, I’ll answer it in a video.</p>

<p>We look forward to staying in touch. Let’s raise the standard and training of all real estate agents in Calgary.</p>
