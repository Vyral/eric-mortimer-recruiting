        <title>Whom Are You Hanging With?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Are you 100% satisfied with all areas of your life? What if you could take a magic wand and change one or two areas - what would those things be?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/LYEi4Hr_MXg?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For thousands of years, feng shui practicers know if you can change your environment, you can change your life. They would add or subtract things from the space. What’s funny though, is they would often miss the people in that equation. People can be poisoning you as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New research on goal contagion actually shows us that we will unconsciously adopt and start pursuing the goals of the people that surround us. Have you seen this in your life?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=The people we hang out with affects what you do, and who you become.%20http://localhost:4000/whom-are-you-hanging-with.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“The people we hang out with affects what you do, and who you become.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a kid, I had just graduated high school and started a construction business with my brothers. I started unconsciously started adopting self destructive behaviors. I didn’t have any real examples around me of people to show me the importance of personal growth or meaningful relationships. I thought, “this just isn’t going to cut it anymore. Something has to change.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I left that environment and those influences, and in contrast now, I live my life by design. I spend my time with purpose driven people that have high values, and my life is spiraling up in all my life areas. I’ve been fortunate to build a business of being a top real estate agent, I have created events, coaching programs and transformation groups that have sold out in hours. And now these people are helping others and it keeps rippling.  If I can do it, as a lost construction worker from Ontario, than you can too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One big reason for the shift is because I changed my friends. It’s who I do, and do not, hang around with.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Difference Working on a Real Estate Team Makes</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/1MgWeuG6NGU?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is it better to work as part of a team or to work as a solo agent?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real estate industry is challenging to work in right now, thanks to shifting market conditions, and this has left many agents looking for ways to put their careers back on track. If you’ve been working as a solo agent, perhaps the best route moving forward is to join a team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But why? What’s so great about joining a team?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, first of all, while being a solo agent does mean you don’t have anyone to report to, this is actually a double-edged sword. Not reporting to anyone is great in concept, but can really damage your success and productivity in practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The first major benefit of working with a team is that, unlike working on your own, you’ll never be without guidance or support&lt;/strong&gt;. Sure, you’re going to be held accountable to your potential—but isn’t that what you want?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surrounding yourself with like-minded people who are real movers and shakers in the industry will always bring you greater success than trying to go it alone. You’ve probably heard of the idea that you’re the average of the five people you spend the most time with, and this is especially true in a professional setting. That’s the real value of being on a team—it will keep you accountable and help you grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Surrounding yourself with like-minded people will always bring you greater success than trying to go it alone.%20http://localhost:4000/the-difference-working-on-a-real-estate-team-makes.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Surrounding yourself with like-minded people will always bring you greater success than trying to go it alone.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But what about the fear of splitting a commission?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think of it this way: Have you ever thought to yourself that FSBO sellers are making a mistake? After all, even though they’d have to pay a commission fee to hire an agent, they’d walk away with more money in their pocket at the end of the deal by doing so. The same applies for real estate professionals. You might have to sacrifice a small portion of your revenue to be part of a team, but that minor sacrifice actually goes toward giving you more resources and a greater opportunity to succeed. Beyond that, you’ll have a mentor working alongside you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of brokerages simply aren’t set up to offer this experience. Being on a team is truly unique in its advantages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, knowing what to do and actually doing it are two different things. It’s easy to go online and find advice about why you should join a team, but only you can take the necessary steps to follow through and do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it happens, our team offers business planning workshops for just this reason. We want to help you act on your goals, so sign up for our next event soon. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.eventbrite.ca/o/eric-mortimer-6168985721&quot;&gt;Find out more information about these workshops here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;
